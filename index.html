				<p>Hi! my name is Andreas Papazafeiropoulos</p>
				<br>
				<p>I studied architecture at the University of Illinois and enjoyed learning about how design and engineering could be used together to create a product that was both aesthetic and functional. Currently I am working as an engineer creating CAD documents for Great Lakes Dredging and Docking CO.</p>
				<br>
				<p>You can see I have a dog from my profile picture. Her name is Pipper and we love spending the days playing outside</p>
